# COM4023-Programming-Concepts-Game

All code within this project must comply with the following guidelines for writing code.
The purpose of this document is to create a unified code base that is simple to read and follows best practices. 

1. All variables must clearly describe what data they hold.
   
   Good:
     User_ID

   Bad:
     User |
     x

3. All variables must use _ to separate words and the start of each word must be capitalised.
   
   Good:
     Music_File_Location

   Bad:
     musicfilelocation |
     music_file_location |
     MusicFileLocation

3. If a variable doesnâ€™t change it must be defined as a constant and all letters should be capitalised.
   
   Good:
   TIME_LIMIT

   Bad:
   Time_Limit

5. Code should never be written twice.

6. Code comments should be used frequently. You should be able to know what steps the code takes by only reading code comments.

7. Code must be indented where applicable.
